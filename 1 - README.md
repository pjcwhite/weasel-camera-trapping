Code and data for "Scent lures and baits at camera traps improve time to first detection and detection probability of two typically elusive species of weasel"

Kate Ebel & Patrick. J. C. White

  Code and data presented in order of analyses in paper of above name.

  For Time To First Detection (TFD) anlayses code and data (numbered 2) are split by all data (n = 126 cameras, 'all') and reduced data(n = 73 cameras which were at least 20 m from another, 'res'). For plots, TFD data are also provided in separate file per season (fall, winter, spring, summer) and per data set ('all', 'res'). 

  For occupancy models to estimate detection probabilities (numbered 3) the code is combined and defaulted to 'all' or contains code to filter to 'res'.
